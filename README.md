# Learning-Management-System
Our project aims to develop a user-friendly Learning Management System (LMS) for students and administrators. It allows students to register, log in, search for books, view details, and save favorites. Administrators can manage books through an intuitive dashboard, adding, updating, and removing records for efficient resource management.
